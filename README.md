# SQL Projects

This repository contains a collection of SQL queries Iâ€™ve worked on for data analysis projects. These queries demonstrate skills in data extraction, transformation, and analysis.

## Key Features
- **Complex Joins**: Combining data from multiple tables.
- **Subqueries & CTEs**: Writing efficient and readable queries.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Handling missing data and formatting inconsistencies.
- **Aggregation & Grouping**: Summarizing data for insights.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- **DB Tools** (pgAdmin, MySQL Workbench, etc.)

## Repository Structure
- `Joins/`: Contains queries using INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL JOIN.
- `Subqueries/`: Demonstrates the use of nested queries and CTEs.
- `Data_Cleaning/`: Queries used for standardizing and cleaning datasets.
- `Aggregation/`: Queries that group and summarize data.
